Some books name something you already understand, but haven't had the words for. *Intertwingled* did that for me. Morville’s writing captures the strange, beautiful chaos of working inside complex organizations, where information overlaps, ownership shifts, and no one quite agrees on what anything should be called. It feels oddly comforting to see that acknowledged in print.

> **“Users do not experience channels. They experience ecosystems.”**

## Everything Is Connected, Even When Systems Aren’t
Working at UCSF has shown me how true this is. No matter how many systems we use or how many teams touch the work, people expect one coherent experience. They don't follow the dotted lines of an org chart. They follow whatever path helps them get a task done. When something in one corner of the system is unclear, that confusion spreads everywhere else.

The same is true for clarity. It radiates outward.

Morville’s framing validates this reality instead of pretending things are tidier than they are.

## Information Architecture Is About Meaning, Not Trees
It’s easy to picture IA as boxes and branches, but real people don’t think in categories. They think in meaning. They group things based on emotion, urgency, familiarity, and what feels right in the moment.

I’ve seen this over and over in interviews and card sorts. The logic people use to find information rarely mirrors the structure an organization uses to store it. And honestly, that’s the interesting part. It’s where the work becomes detective-level fun.

> **“Meaning is messy. Users organize content by whatever helps them move forward.”**

## Intertwingled Design Requires Humility
This is something I wish more teams understood. A small tweak to a label can affect search. Adjusting a definition can ripple into how confident someone feels doing their job. Even a tiny shift in structure can change how a workflow is perceived.

Morville’s perspective reminds us that UX isn’t just interface design. It's diplomacy, translation, and a willingness to accept that every decision affects more than one place.

## Complexity Has an Emotional Weight
One thing the book captures quietly but powerfully is the emotional load of complexity. People bring stress, doubt, and pressure with them into every interaction. When systems contradict each other or feel scattered, that anxiety amplifies.

But when a part of the experience feels grounded and clear, people carry that confidence forward. Clarity is contagious.

## A Practical, Human Way to Approach UX
This is why I’m drawn to *Intertwingled*. It describes the world as it really is: nonlinear, intertwined, and shaped by human decisions. UX is not about eliminating complexity but guiding people through it with structure and empathy.

> **“Complexity is not a failure. It’s a condition. Our job is to help people navigate it.”**

Morville’s thinking has shaped the way I approach IA, research, and collaboration. It gives language to the things you notice after years inside enterprise systems, and it confirms that the work of untangling messy environments will always matter.
